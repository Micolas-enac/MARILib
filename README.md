# MARILib
Multidisciplinary Airplane Research Integrated Library

MARILib is a model library developped as a new test case to benchmark optimization algorithms and Multidisciplinary
Design Optimization (MDO) formulations.

MARILibâ€™s first objective is to provide models for research on a wide range of aircraft concepts, from business jets
to super jumbos, and also some unconventional configurations, through an Overall Aircraft Design (OAD) approach.

The second objective is to share a new benchmark test case for MDO strategies, which does not raise intellectual
property issues.

The third objective is to describe a case study for educational and training purposes.
